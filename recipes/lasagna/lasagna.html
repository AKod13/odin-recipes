        <h3>How to Make Lasagna</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Bell peppers</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Tomato juice</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Noodles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan. </li>
            <li>Assembly: A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat assembly until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
        </ol>
